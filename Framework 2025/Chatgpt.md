### üõ†Ô∏è **Workflow: Excel ‚Üí MCQ (Aiken Format) with Difficulty Level**

---

### **Step 1: Structure Your Excel File**

Assume a simple structure in Excel:

| Topic                | Content Summary                                                                                                             | Difficulty | Notes               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| Serverless Computing | Serverless computing allows developers to build and run applications without managing infrastructure.                       | Difficult  | Focus on benefits   |
| OSI Layers           | The OSI model has 7 layers. Each layer serves specific functions, such as routing, encryption, etc.                         | Medium     | Emphasize functions |
| IaaS vs PaaS         | IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. PaaS offers hardware and software tools over the internet. | Difficult  | Compare features    |

### **Step 2: Convert with Python + OpenAI (or ChatGPT UI)**

You can either:

* Use **ChatGPT** directly with a prompt (see below), or
* Use **Python** to loop through Excel rows and call GPT API.

---

### **Step 3: Prompt Template (for ChatGPT or GPT API)**

You can copy-paste this into ChatGPT with your content:

> **Prompt Template:**
>
> "Generate 1 difficult-level multiple-choice question in **Aiken format** based on the following content. Do not repeat questions. Focus on technical accuracy.
> **Content**: `{{Your Content Here}}`
> **Topic**: `{{Topic Name}}`
>
> Format strictly as:
> **Question**
> A. Option 1
> B. Option 2
> C. Option 3
> D. Option 4
> ANSWER: X
>
> Do not include explanations."

---

### ‚úÖ **Sample Output (Aiken Format)**

From this content:

> *"Serverless computing allows developers to build and run applications without managing infrastructure."*

Generated MCQ:

```
Which of the following best describes serverless computing?
A. Developers manage physical servers to deploy applications.
B. Applications are executed only on on-premise servers.
C. Developers deploy code without managing the underlying infrastructure.
D. Serverless computing eliminates the need for cloud services.
ANSWER: C
```

### üö´ De-duplication Tip

If using automation:

* Keep a **hash or text match log** of all questions generated.
* Before saving a new MCQ, **check against existing** ones using `difflib` or cosine similarity (for fuzzy matches).
* In ChatGPT, simply add: *‚ÄúDo not repeat any previously generated questions.‚Äù*

---

### üì§ Optional: Export to `.txt` or LMS

Once generated, you can:

* Save to `.txt` file for Moodle or import into LMS.
* Store in Excel with columns: `Topic | Question | A | B | C | D | Answer | Difficulty`.

Would you like a **Python script** to automate this from Excel with OpenAI API or prefer to work entirely within ChatGPT UI?
